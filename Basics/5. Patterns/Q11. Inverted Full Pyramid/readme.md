### Problem Description

Take an integer N as input, and print the corresponding Inverted Full Pyramid pattern for N.

For example if N = 5 then pattern will be like:
```
* * * * * 
 * * * * 
  * * * 
   * *    
    * 
```

>NOTE: There should be exactly one extra space after each * for each row.

Problem Constraints
```
2 <= N <= 100
```

Input Format
```
First and only line of input contains a single integer N.
```

Output Format
```

```
 3
```

>Input 3:
```
 4
```
